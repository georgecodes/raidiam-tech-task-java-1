Raidiam Java Dev Tech Task
==========================

This is a simple Spring Boot application which implements a naive, insecure account API. 
There is an existing endpoint for looking up all accounts held by a particular customer. There are passing tests for this.

We now have a requirement that we should be able to look up all the transactions on a specific account. There are already 
failing tests for this. Your task is to write sufficient code that these failing tests pass.
